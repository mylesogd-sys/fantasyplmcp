## Summary of Changes Made

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the Fantasy PL MCP project for PyPI distribution.

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

- Added `publish-to-pypi.yml` for automated PyPI publishing on new releases
- Created `package-check.yml` to verify package can be built without running tests
- Simplified CI process to avoid dependency issues with MCP package

### 2. Package Metadata

- Updated `pyproject.toml`:
  - Added more comprehensive classifiers
  - Added keywords for better discoverability
  - Added development dependencies
  - Updated Python version requirement to 3.10+
  - Changed dependency from "mcp" to "anthropic-mcp"

- Updated `setup.py`:
  - Updated Python version requirement to 3.10+
  - Changed dependency from "mcp" to "anthropic-mcp"

### 3. Documentation

- Enhanced `README.md`:

  - Added requirements section specifying Python 3.10+
  - Added contributing section and citation information
  - Improved formatting and structure

- Added new files:

  - `DISTRIBUTION.md` - Comprehensive guide for publishing to PyPI

### 4. PyPI Preparation

- Configured GitHub Actions secrets for PyPI publishing
- Created detailed instructions for both manual and automated publishing

## Next Steps

1. Create a PyPI account if you don't have one already
2. Add GitHub repository secrets for PyPI credentials:
   - `PYPI_USERNAME`: Your PyPI username
   - `PYPI_PASSWORD`: Your PyPI password or token

3. Create a new GitHub release to trigger the publishing workflow
4. Verify the package is published correctly on PyPI
5. Install the package from PyPI to test it works as expected

## Notes on MCP Dependency

The MCP package is listed as "anthropic-mcp" in the dependencies. This package is published by Anthropic and may require Python 3.10 or higher. If you need to support older Python versions, you'll need to modify the dependency requirements and test compatibility.
